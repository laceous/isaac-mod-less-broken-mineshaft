    <description>Walking down the mineshaft to get to Knife Piece 2 is boring. Now, you can ride the minecart all the way in. You'll still have to fight your way out.

Note: you can skip the minecart ride by bombing your way in.

Support for the following mods has been added:
[list]
    [*]Fall from Grace (Grotto)
    [*]Fiend Folio Reheated (mineshaft rooms)
[/list]

Other mods that add mineshaft rooms that don't have direct support right now (e.g. Rooms Galore) shouldn't cause any issues. Those rooms will be skipped.

This mod requires REPENTOGON.</description>
